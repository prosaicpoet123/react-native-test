The pollution free New Zealand environment ensures that every jar is honey as nature intended.</p><br><p>Multifloral Manuka Honey is mainly honey from a Manuka bush, but the bees have travelled further afield so it contains a wider range of nectar from other plants.</p>",

MGO (Methylglyoxal) rating in Manuka honey is derived from DHA which is naturally present in the nectar of the Manuka Bush. Within the hive DHA undergoes he Maillard reaction to form MGO. Our MGO levels are validated by independent labs in NZ and the UK.</p><br><p> Manuka honey is made by the bees gathering pollen from the Manuka bush (Leptospermum Scoparium). The plant is indigenous to New Zealand, beekeepers set up their hives in wild uncultivated areas in which Manuka bushes grow. Manuka Doctor honey is 100% pure New Zealand honey and is not blended with honey from other nations. The pollution free New Zealand environment ensures that every jar is honey as nature intended.</p><br><p>Monofloral Manuka Honey is made by bees foraging mainly from Manuka bushes, so it contains only a small amount of nectar from other plants.
